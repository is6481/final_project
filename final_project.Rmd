## Final Project -- Maturity Assessment

The purpose of this project is to take the lecture materials from the course and apply them in practice. To do this, I would like you to use the "four scenarios" from Chapter 2 to assess the BI maturity of some organization, apply your criteria to an organization you are involved with, and then describe how the organization can move from one level to another.

### A few notes about the organization you choose.

* The ideal situation is that you analyze your current employer. 
* You do not have to tell me the name of your employer, in fact, I prefer you don't. Simply choose a name to call the company throughout the report.
* You should not need to share any confidential details from your employer to successfully complete this assignment.
* If you are not currently employed or otherwise need to find another organization to analyze, please let me know before the end of the third week of this course.

### Suggested format

* The Four Scenarios from Chapter 2 will be used as a BI Maturity model.
* Copy the grid from 02.03 Four Scenarios slide 25 into your presentation.
* Highlight one item from each column representing the current state of the chosen organization.
* Write a few sentances on why each critera was selected.
* Describe how the organization can move from the current level for each criteria to the next level.

### Notes about the paper

* Your paper should include the following three sections
	* (5 points) Brief/high-level summary of the organization you are analyzing. Including industry and business description along with any details about the department you are focusing on.
	* (15 points) Summary of BI Maturity criteria - bullet list perfectly acceptable, preferably in a visual format (e.g. a summary table).
	* (15 points) Description of your organization's current BI maturity level - make sure to point out the specific elements that put the organization in that level.
	* (15 points) Explanation of what needs to happen for the organization to move from the current level to the next level.
* Your paper does not have to be too long. In my mind, you should be able to accomplish this in 3-5 pages.
* You do not need to make any value judgments about how well the organization is managed.
* This is intended to be a write up in either a PDF or MS Word file. It is possible to create a Power Point presentation but I am likely to be more picky for projects submitted in that format.

## Requirements

1. Create a set of criteria to assess the BI maturity of an organization (this could be a company or department). 
	* Your assessment should include at least three levels of maturity.
	* Use the material in chapter 2 as a guide.
2. Find an organization and write up a complete assessment of the current state.
3. Create an action plan to move from the current level to the next level.
