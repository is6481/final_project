Final Project
-------------

Choose one of the following four options and upload the results to
Canvas before the assigned due date.

If you are on the fence, note that your instructor prefers Option 1.

### Option 1 – Maturity Assessment

1.  Create a set of criteria to assess the BI maturity of an
    organization (this could be a company or department). Your
    assessment should include at least three levels of maturity.
2.  Find an organization and apply your criteria.
3.  Create an action plan to move from the current level to the next
    level.

Note that chapter 2 will be used to grade this assignment.

### Option 2 – Dashboard Creation

1.  Create a dashboard using your front-end tool of choice.
2.  Dashboard should target a specific job function or business
    initiative.
3.  Provide a description of the business objectives that require the
    dashboard.
4.  Provide a training document for new users of the dashboard.
5.  If not using public or anonymized data, provide written permission
    for the data to be used in this project by the responsible party.

A few notes about this project.

-   You do not have to use Domo. If you do, please use the classroom
    Domo instance as it will be cleaned up after the class is over.
    -   If you use a different Domo instance, note that you may be
        liable for any data breach.
-   If you can’t tell, I’d like you to be very careful about the
    sensitive nature of the data used for this project.

### Option 3 – Unsupervised Learning

1.  Find a data set appropriate for unsupervised learning.
2.  Perform the necessary data prep.
3.  Create a set of clusters and name them.
4.  Provide a write-up that describes the following.
    -   The origin of the data.
    -   How the solution can be used in a business context.
    -   Descriptions of each cluster along with a justification for the
        naming of each cluster.

Note: please be careful using sensitive data for this project.

### Option 4 – Supervised Learning

1.  Find a data set appropriate for supervised learning.
2.  Perform the necessary data prep.
3.  Run a supervised learning algorithm to create a model.
4.  Provide a write-up that describes the following.
    -   The data prep needed to run the selected model.
    -   Which model was chosen and why.
    -   How the results of the model will be used in a business context

Note: please be careful using sensitive data for this project.
