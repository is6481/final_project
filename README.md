Final Project – Maturity Assessment
-----------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to take the lecture materials from the
course and apply them in practice. To do this, I would like you to
create/summarize a set of criteria that helps to assess the BI maturity
of some organization, apply your criteria to an organization you are
involved with, and then describe how the organization can move from one
level to another.

A few notes about the organization you choose.

-   The ideal situation is that you analyze your current employer.
-   You do not have to tell me the name of your employer, in fact, I
    prefer you don’t. Simply choose a name to call the company
    throughout the report.
-   You should not need to share any confidential details from your
    employer to successfully complete this assignment.
-   If you are not currently employed or otherwise need to find another
    organization to analyze, please let me know before the end of the
    third week of this course.
