## Final Project – Maturity Assessment

The purpose of this project is to take the lecture materials from the
course and apply them in practice. To do this, I would like you to use
the “four scenarios” from Chapter 2 to assess the BI maturity of some
organization, apply your criteria to an organization you are involved
with, and then describe how the organization can move from one level to
another.

### A few notes about the organization you choose.

-   The ideal situation is that you analyze your current employer.
-   You do not have to tell me the name of your employer, in fact, I
    prefer you don’t. Simply choose a name to call the company
    throughout the report.
-   You should not need to share any confidential details from your
    employer to successfully complete this assignment.
-   If you are not currently employed or otherwise need to find another
    organization to analyze, please let me know before the end of the
    third week of this course.

### Suggested format

-   The Four Scenarios from Chapter 2 will be used as a BI Maturity
    model.
-   Copy the grid from 02.03 Four Scenarios slide 25 into your
    presentation.
-   Highlight one item from each column representing the current state
    of the chosen organization.
-   Write a few sentances on why each critera was selected.
-   Describe how the organization can move from the current level for
    each criteria to the next level.

### Requirements

-   Using the grid on slide 25 of the Four Scenarios lecture, assess the
    BI maturity of an organization (this could be a company or
    department).
-   Your paper should include the following three sections
    -   (5 points) Brief/high-level summary of the organization you are
        analyzing. Including industry and business description along
        with any details about the department you are focusing on.
    -   (5 points) Copy of the table from slide 25 of the 02.03 Four
        Scenarios slides with highlights.
    -   (20 points) Description of your organization’s current BI
        maturity level - make sure to point out the specific elements
        that put the organization in that level.
    -   (20 points) Explanation of what needs to happen for the
        organization to move from the current level to the next level.

### Notes

-   Your paper does not have to be too long. You should be able to
    accomplish this in 3-5 pages.
-   You do not need to make any value judgments about how well the
    organization is managed.
-   Reminder that no confidential details are to be included in the
    paper.
-   This is intended to be a write up in either a PDF or MS Word file.
    It is possible to create a Power Point presentation but I am likely
    to be more picky for projects submitted in that format.
