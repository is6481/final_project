## Final Project – Maturity Assessment

The purpose of this project is to take the lecture materials from the
course and apply them in practice. To do this, I would like you to
create/summarize a set of criteria that helps to assess the BI maturity
of some organization, apply your criteria to an organization you are
involved with, and then describe how the organization can move from one
level to another.

### A few notes about the organization you choose.

-   The ideal situation is that you analyze your current employer.
-   You do not have to tell me the name of your employer, in fact, I
    prefer you don’t. Simply choose a name to call the company
    throughout the report.
-   You should not need to share any confidential details from your
    employer to successfully complete this assignment.
-   If you are not currently employed or otherwise need to find another
    organization to analyze, please let me know before the end of the
    third week of this course.

### Notes about criteria

-   Chapter 2 does a good job of outlining possible criteria for BI
    maturity. I suggest you use that as your basic outline, but this is
    not a requirement.
-   Criteria should be simple and clear.
-   Criteria should not relate to company performance or culture.

### Notes about the paper

-   Your paper should include the following three sections
    -   (5 points) Brief/high-level summary of the organization you are
        analyzing. Including industry and business description along
        with any details about the department you are focusing on.
    -   (15 points) Summary of BI Maturity criteria - bullet list
        perfectly acceptable, preferably in a visual format (e.g. a
        summary table).
    -   (15 points) Description of your organization’s current BI
        maturity level - make sure to point out the specific elements
        that put the organization in that level.
    -   (15 points) Explanation of what needs to happen for the
        organization to move from the current level to the next level.
-   Your paper does not have to be too long. In my mind, you should be
    able to accomplish this in 3-5 pages.
-   You do not need to make any value judgments about how well the
    organization is managed.
-   This is intended to be a write up in either a PDF or MS Word file.
    It is possible to create a Power Point presentation but I am likely
    to be more picky for projects submitted in that format.

## Requirements

1.  Create a set of criteria to assess the BI maturity of an
    organization (this could be a company or department).
    -   Your assessment should include at least three levels of
        maturity.
    -   Use the material in chapter 2 as a guide.
2.  Find an organization and write up a complete assessment of the
    current state.
3.  Create an action plan to move from the current level to the next
    level.
