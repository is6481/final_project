Final Project â€“ Maturity Assessment
-----------------------------------

1.  Create a set of criteria to assess the BI maturity of an
    organization (this could be a company or department).
    -   Your assessment should include at least three levels of
        maturity.
    -   Use the material in chapter 2 as a guide.
2.  Find an organization and write up a complete assessment of the
    current state.
3.  Create an action plan to move from the current level to the next
    level.
